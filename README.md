# Making Tetris in 2 hours
 
Two successful attempts at making old games in 2 hours. Why not atempt a third.

<b>Still working on it</b>
Maybe starting a new project in the middle of the night/morning isnt the best idea. 
Maybe I underestimated the complexity of the project.

But for whatever reason the movement is kinda tricky to get right.
